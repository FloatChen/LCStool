# LCStool
LCS Tool is a computational engine for analyzing fluid flows by extracting their most influential material surfaces, Lagrangian Coherent Structures. LCS Tool is built on recent theoretical developments performed by [Prof. George Haller](http://georgehaller.com/about/members/george-haller.html) and his [research group](http://georgehaller.com) at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://ethz.ch). The tool is being developed by the same group.

Demo scripts
------------

MATLAB scripts demonstrating the use of LCS Tool are in the folder named demo. To run these scripts, start MATLAB in the LCS Tool folder, then at the MATLAB prompt type, for example:

	cd(fullfile('demo','double_gyre'))
	addpath(fullfile('..','..'))
	elliptic_hyperbolic_lcs
